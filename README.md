# InvariableAI

**InvariableAI** is a fully local, open-source LLM framework where the AI's identity is locked in place using a single `.txt` file — and cannot be altered during use.

Forget prompt injections. Forget personality leaks. Forget censorship.

> You define how the AI speaks, behaves, and what tools it can use — and that stays *invariable*.

## Key Features

- **Persona Lock System**  
  AI personality is defined once via `persona.txt`, and cannot be changed mid-conversation — not even by clever prompt attacks.

- **Modular Tool Interface**  
  Add tools like file reading, image generation, or video creation. Enable only what your AI should have access to.

- **Fully Local and Offline-Ready**  
  Works with local LLMs (like Mistral, LLaMA) via Ollama or other backends. No cloud, no spying.

- **Extremely Customizable UI** *(coming soon)*  
  ChatGPT-style GUI with switchable tool icons, themes, and user-side modding.
